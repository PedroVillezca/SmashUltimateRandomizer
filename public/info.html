          <h1>About this randomizer</h1>
          <p>
            This randomizer was created with the purpose of expanding upon the random functionality offered within Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. It offers the ability to restrict which characters, skins, stages and forms may appear, all of which are features games in the Super Smash Bros. series have never had. Through this webpage, it is also possible to look up and download randomization settings uploaded by other users, in case they are looking for a quick start or some amusing ideas.

          <h1>The Main Page</h1>
          <p>
            The main page contains the main feature of this website: the randomizer. Simply select one of the randomization settings you've saved from the right sidebar by clicking on it and press the randomize button. The randomly selected character and stage will appear on screen.

          <h1>The Settings Page</h1>
          <p>
            The settings page is where sets are created, edited and saved. By default, all characters, skins, stages, and forms are enabled. You can toggle them by clicking on each of them individually, or by using the buttons at the top right of each section. An enabled element will appear completely solid, whereas a disabled element will appear semi-transparent. If you choose to make your randomization setting public, it will be allowed to appear on any user's search results. When downloading or editing a randomization setting you didn't originally make, you won't be able to make your own copies of them public.

          <h1>The Search Page</h1>
          <p>
            The search page is where randomization settings from other users can be found. It is possible to filter them out depending on which characters and stages they must include, as well as which tags they have. This website uses the exact same spelling as the official Super Smash Bros. Ultimate website for all character and stage names, so if you are having trouble using the search feature's character and stage filters, refer to that website for the correct spelling.

          <h1>The Profile Page</h1>
          <p>
            The profile page is where you can access all of your existing randomization settings. You may notice you appear as the owner on all of the settings, even ones that you've downloaded from the search page. This is because what you're actually seeing is your own copy of the original settings. This way, you can edit or remove the settings without affecting anyone else's information. However, in order to prevent the search page from having too many redundant results, you will not be able to make these copies public, only randomization settings you've created from scratch can be made public.

            The info page is where you read about all of the other, more interesting pages. If you're reading this, it means you already know how this website works (or you skipped all of my painstakingly written explanation). Congratulations!
