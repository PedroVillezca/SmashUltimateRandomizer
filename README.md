# SmashUltimateRandomizer

[Link](https://frozen-meadow-13848.herokuapp.com/)

This randomizer was created with the purpose of expanding upon the random functionality offered within Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. It offers the ability to restrict which characters, skins, stages and forms may appear, all of which are features games in the Super Smash Bros. series have never had. Through this webpage, it is also possible to look up and download randomization settings uploaded by other users, in case they are looking for a quick start or some amusing ideas.

## Usage

To use the randomizer, you must first have some randomization settings. The website doesn't provide any by default, but there are two ways to create them:

1. Create a new one from the **Settings** page.

    <pre>
    <b>Step 1:</b> Enter the Settings page.
    <b>Step 2:</b> Toggle the characters and stages you want to include. By default, everything is <b>toggled on</b>
    when creating a new set.
    <b>Step 3:</b> Give your settings a name, add whichever tags best describe it (or none at all) and choose
    whether you'd like to make it private or public.
    <b>Step 4:</b> Click on the <b>"Save"</b> button.
    Assuming everything went right, you should now be looking at your <b>Home</b> page with your newly created
    settings listed to the right of the page.
    </pre>

2. Copy an existing one from the **Search** page.

  <pre>
  <b>Step 1:</b> Enter the Search page.
  <b>Step 2:</b> List the characters and stages you want the search results to include, or leave it
  blank if you have no preference.
  <b>Step 3:</b> Choose the tags that the search results must include. You can opt to choose none
  as well.
  <b>Step 4:</b> Click on the <b>"Search"</b> button.
  <b>Step 5:</b> Choose whichever result catches your eye and press the <b>"Save"</b> button.
  <b>Step 6:</b> Scroll down the newly opened <b>Settings</b> page, editing the settings if you like.
  <b>Step 7:</b> When you're done, press the "Save" button.
  Assuming everything went right, you should now be looking at your <b>Profile</b> page, which will list
  a newly created copy of the set you just saved.
  </pre>
 
Once you have at least one set, simply head over to the **Home** page and click on the **"Randomize"** button. The site will display a character, stage, and stage form according to the settings you currently have selected. If you would like to switch them around, click on the title of the settings you want to use on the right sidebar and press the **"Randomize"** button again.

If you want to edit or remove a set, you can do so in your **Profile** page. Simply look for the set you want, and either press the **"Remove"** or **"Edit"** buttons. Removing a set will immediately delete it from the site, whereas editing works similarly to creating or downloading one, except that any changes you make will be applied to the existing set instead of creating a new one. Please note that downloaded sets cannot be made public to mitigate saturation of the search function.


## Roadmap

There are a couple of potential features the site could receive as future updates:

1. Display global metrics that reflect the usage patterns of the website.

2. Allow randomization of multiple characters at once to support local multiplayer use.

However, there are no plans to carry these out as of yet.
